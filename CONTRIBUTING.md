# CONTRIBUTING

Welcome to dash-canvas! Contributions, bug reports, comments about the
package are very welcome. The project is hosted on
https://github.com/plotly/dash-canvas. 

This project was initially generated by the
[dash-component-boilerplate](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate),
which contains the minimal set of code required to create your own custom
Dash component.

##Â Structure of the code:

- the source code of the ``dash_canvas.DashCanvas`` canvas reactive
  object is the JavaScript React class in
``src/lib/components/DashCanvas.react.js``. If you are not familiar with
React and JavaScript, [this
tutorial](https://dash.plot.ly/react-for-python-developers) is a good
primer. In order to build the Javascript component: execute at the root
of the package

```
npm run build:all
```

- the ``dash_canvas/utils`` submodule contains utility functions in order
  to use annotations retrieved from the DashCanvas object for further
image processing.

- for examples of applications using dash-canvas, see the https://github.com/plotly/canvas-portal. These examples show in particular how to write callbacks using the DashCanvas object properties.

## Testing

For testing the DashCanvas objects using Selenium 

```
pytest tests --webdriver Chrome
```

(or using another webdriver).

For testing the Python package and utility functions 

```
pytest dash_canvas
```
